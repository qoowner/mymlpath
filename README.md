# MyMLpath
Hi. I don't know if anyone will read this, but I'll write a description anyway! I started my way in ML very recently and I'm learning a lot, I have a dream to create my own startup or get a job in the future in OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic or other AI companies. If anyone ever comes in here besides me, my plan is to see my progress. And if my projects are useful someday, and not just as a part of learning, I'll be happy to share them ðŸ¤—
